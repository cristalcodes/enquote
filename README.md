# Enquote

This application is a simple way to save your favorite quotes. Your quotes are kept in their own section. If you need more inspiration, you can see books that were added by other users and the quotes associated with them. As your quote collection grows, you can use the search feature to find that quote you're looking for without hassle. 

## Getting Started

Dependencies 

```
install yarn 

bundle install
```

Setup Oauth for Github to have the same functionality as the project. (Optional)
https://github.com/omniauth/omniauth-github

Now you're ready to run the rails server using: 

```
rails s
```

Then navigate to http://localhost:3000/ in your browser

and you should see a beautiful home page!
